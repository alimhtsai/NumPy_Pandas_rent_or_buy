## NumPy_Pandas_rent_or_buy
I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot a statistical data visualization to see how data was distributed and applied the results to build a user-approach housing search website with Django.
See the user-approach housing search website at [django_rent_or_buy](https://github.com/alimhtsai/django_rent_or_buy)
